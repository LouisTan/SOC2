a. *Password protection*

    i. All passwords are treated as confidential information and should not be shared with anyone. If you receive a request to share a password, deny the request and contact the system owner for assistance in provisioning an individual user account. 

    i. Do not write down passwords, store them in emails, electronic notes, or mobile devices, or share them over the phone. Do not use the “Remember Password” feature of applications and web browsers. All passwords must be stored using MyGlue password manager. If you truly must share a password, do so through a MyGlue password manager. 

    i. If you suspect a password has been compromised, rotate the password immediately and notify IT.
