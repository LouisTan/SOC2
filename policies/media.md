# Purpose and Scope

a. This removable media, cloud storage and Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) policy defines the objectives, requirements and implementing instructions for storing data on removable media, in cloud environments, and on personally-owned devices, regardless of data classification level.

a. This policy applies to all information and data within the organization’s information security program, all removable media, cloud systems either owned or controlled by the organization as well as employee's personally-owned devices used for work related tasks.

a. This policy applies to all users of information systems within the organization. This typically includes employees and contractors, as well as any external parties that come into contact with systems and information controlled by the organization (hereinafter referred to as “users”). This policy must be made readily available to all users.

# Background

a. This policy defines the procedures for safely using removable media, cloud storage and personally-owned devices to limit data loss or exposure. Such forms of storage must be strictly controlled because of the sensitive data that can be stored on them. Because each of these storage types are inherently ephemeral or portable in nature, it is possible for the organization to lose the ability to oversee or control the information stored on them if strict security standards are not followed.

a. This document consists of three sections pertaining to removable media, cloud storage, and personally-owned devices. Each section contains requirements and implementing instructions for the registration, management, maintenance, and disposition of each type of storage.

a. Within this policy, the term sensitive information refers to information that is classified as INTERNAL USE or CONFIDENTIAL in accordance with the Data Classification Policy (reference (a)).
